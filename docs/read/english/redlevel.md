The verb "do" is a very important verb.

We use it to make the present tense,
the present tense negative,
and for asking questions.

**Examples:**

`I do many things on the weekend.` (present tense, "do" is the main verb)

`He doesn't like to go to the store.` (present tense negative, "like" is the main verb)

`Do you want to see a movie?` (present tense question, "want" is the main verb)

"Do" is often used as a main verb, but only for **particular activities**,
such as housework, cleaning, studying, research, and shopping.

**Examples:**

`I do the dishes every night.` (do = wash)

`She does her grocery shopping at Cub.` (do = go/finish)

`They do their homework at the library.` (do = complete)

The past tense form of "do" is "did."

**Examples:**

`I did the dishes last night.`

`She did her grocery shopping at Cub.`

"Do" is also used for creating emphasis:

**Example:**

**A**: You don't like this very much.

**B**: No. I do like it!

The verb "do" is a helping verb.
Use "do" to make the present tense and the past tense negative.
The verb "do" is also a main verb.

[The video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05JqFOKE9DQ) explains the difference between a helping verb and a main verb.

**Examples in the present tense:**

- I don't work on the weekend. (present tense negative)
- He doesn't like to go to the store. (present tense negative)
- They don't have any money. (present tense negative)

**Examples in the past tense:**  The past tense form of "do" is "did". Did + not = didn't

- I didn't work last night.
- She didn't go shopping yesterday.
- We didn't see that movie yet...

**Be careful:** "Do" is also used as a main verb,
but only for particular activities,
such as housework, cleaning, studying, research, business, and shopping.

**Examples in the past tense:**

- She didn't do her grocery shopping at Cub.

Separating the contraction creates emphasis

**Examples:**

- I do not want to do the dishes.
- He does not have his license.
- Please, do not put that hot pan on the counter.

`Never put do + not + ____ing`

- He doesn't going to work.( incorrect )

Avoid bad American grammar!

- She don't go to work on Sunday.
- It don't matter to me.

The verb "do" is a helping verb.
We add it to the simple form of a verb to make questions and negatives in the present tense and the past tense.

**Examples:**

- I `don't work` on the weekend. (present tense negative).
- I `didn't work` last weekend. (past tense negative)
- He `doesn't like` to go to the store. (present tense negative)
- He `didn't like` to go to the store when he was younger. (past tense negative).
- They `don't have` any money. (present tense negative)
- They `didn't have` any money last week. (past tense negative.)

**Note**: "Do" is also used as a main verb for activities, such as housework, cleaning, studying, research, business, and shopping.

**Examples:**

- I `don't do` the dishes every night.
- I `didn't do` the dishes last night.
- She `doesn't do` her grocery shopping at Cub.
- She `didn't do` her grocery shopping yesterday.
- They `do not do` their homework at the library.
- They `didn't do` their homework last night.
- Their company `doesn't do` business in Minnesota.
- They _never_ `did` business here.

The past tense form of "do" is "did."  Did + not = didn't

**Examples:**

- I didn't go to work yesterday.
- She didn't take the bus to work.

Separating the contraction creates emphasis.

**Examples:**

- I `did` _not_ `want` to do the dishes last night.
- I `do` _not_ `want` to do them now!
- He `does` _not_ `have` his license!
- He _never_ `did` get it!
- Please, `do` not `put` that hot pan on the counter!

Never put "did" + `___`ing together.

- He <s>did going</s>  to work last night. (incorrect)
- He went to work last night. ( correct )

Avoid bad American grammar!

- She <s>don't go</s> to work on Sunday. (She doesn't go to work on Sunday.)
- It <s>don't matter</s> to me. (It doesn't matter to me.)
- He <s>don't know</s>. (He doesn't know.)

## RL4 Commands

Begin the sentence with a verb and end with an object, a person or a thing.

Tell someone to do something:

- `Answer` the phone, please.
- `Drive` to the post office.
- `Help` me find this information.

The subject in each of these sentences is "you,"
but it doesn't sound correct to use the subject.

- <s>You help me.</s>

Tell someone not to do something:

- Don't do that. (The subject is "you.")
- Don't hit him.
- Don't drive a car without a seat belt.

In each sentence above, the present tense is used and the subject is "you.
The polite form of a command uses the word "please."

### Reading Time : A farm is a great place to work

A farm is a great place to work.
There are many different jobs to do on a farm,
and farmers spend most of their time outside in the spring, summer, and fall.
Winter is nice also if you don't mind being outside when it's cold.

Farms in the United States produce `crops` such as `corn`, `wheat`, `soybeans`, and `cotton`.
Farms in California and Florida can grow `crops` all year round,
so `the orange juice` you had for breakfast probably came from one of those states.

Some farmers raise `cows` for the production of milk and cheese.
They're called `dairy farmers`.
Dairy farms are very popular in the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Farmers who grow apples and `pears` have large `orchards`.
They're very busy in the fall months of September and October when the fruit `ripens`.
You can go to an `orchard` in the fall and pick your own apples.
By visiting an `orchard`, you can learn a little about what it's like to work on a farm.

**1. Yes-No Questions:**

Q: Do you want some water?

and "want" is the main verb.
Use "do" or "does," depending on the subject.

When the baby comes,
Sandra is going to take a six-month leave of absence from her job.
She wants to spend a lot of time with her new baby.

### Reading Time : Matthew gets ready to go to work

Matthew gets ready to go to work early every morning.
After he wakes up, he makes himself some coffee,
he reads the newspaper, `shaves` and showers, and he has breakfast.
This morning Matthew is running late,
so he only has enough time to `shave` before he leaves his `apartment`.

Matthew turns on the water.
The water from the `faucet` is cold,
so he lets the water run for a minute before `cupping` his hands together and `splashing` water on his face.
The warm water feels good on his skin,
and it helps him wake up a little.

He puts on the `shaving cream` and he begins to shave.
Matthew is careful when he `shaves` because he doesn't want to cut himself.
First he `shaves` under his `nose`,
then he `shaves` from the right side of his face to the left side of his face.

When he's finished `shaving`,
Matthew `rinses` his face with water to get the shaving cream off.
He `dries` his face off with a `towel`, gets `dressed`, and heads to work.
Once he `arrives` at work,
he'll get some coffee from the coffee shop near his office.

**How much do you remember from the reading ? Fill in the blanks.**

1A: Why doesn't Matthew make coffee for himself this morning?

## RL7 Special Uses for the Verb "Do"

The verb "do" is a little confusing.
Not only is it a helping verb,
it's a main verb as well.
For example, to ask someone about his or her job, say...

"What do you **do**?"

The first verb in that question is a helping verb, `do`;
the second verb in that question is the main verb, `do`.

**Examples:**

Q: What do you `do`?

A: I'm a cashier.

It's interesting to note that the answer does not require the verb do.
In this case the answer uses the verb be.

Q: What do you `do` at work?

A: I help customers.

Q: What do you do everyday?

A: I go to school.

What did they do?

They got married.

<s>They do married.</s> No!

What is he doing?

He's smoking.

<s>He's doing smoking.</s> No!

**But sometimes "do" is used as the main verb.**

In fact, "do" is a very popular main verb for some activities.
It can be used for exercising, studying, cleaning, working, and other general behaviors.

**examples below:**

 | Question                    | Answer                                                                                                                               |

 | What is she doing?          | She's working on her laptop. <br/> or .... <br/> She's doing some work on her laptop. (laptop=computer)                              |

### Reading Time : Carolyn recently lost her husband

Carolyn recently lost her husband.
He died of `cancer` a year ago.
His name was Brad.
Now Carolyn lives by herself.
She feels lonely without her husband,
but her children still visit her on the weekends,
and that makes her feel less lonely.

Carolyn finds `comfort` in taking long walks in the forest.
She and her husband used to go on long walks together,
so when she takes a walk in the forest,
it reminds her of her husband,
and it brings back a lot of happy memories.
Because she works as an `artist`,
a walk in the forest also `provides` her with `inspiration` for her work.

Carolyn's oldest daughter is 34 years old.
Her name is Kathleen,
but everyone calls her "Kathy."
Kathy works as a `nurse` at a hospital.
She's married and she has two small children.
One is a three-year-old boy named Kevin,
and the other is an eleven-month-old girl named Lisa.
Kathy and her children come to visit Carolyn as often as possible.
They call Carolyn "Gramma."

Carolyn's other daughter lives in New York.
Her name is Samantha.
She's 26 years old, single, and she works as a `waitress`,
but she hopes to find a job someday as an `actress`.
Samantha comes home to visit her mother at least two or three times a year, usually during the holidays.

Brad is the youngest of Carolyn's three children.
He's named after his father.
He also looks a little like his father.
He's 24 years old and he's going to finish law school in a few months.
He hopes to get a job as a lawyer after he takes the bar `exam`.
Brad wants to remain in the same town where his mother lives because he's very close to his mother,
and he loves living in the town where he grew up.

Brad is going to get married next year.
He has a two-year-old son from a previous marriage.
His son's name is Justin.
Carolyn often takes care of her grandson,
Justin, during the day while Brad `attends` law school.

| (Only use an article with these: a or the) | (These plural count nouns use "many") | (These use "much")                              |

**It's important to understand the difference between noncount and count nouns when using many and much.**

**Noncount nouns are often used to describe large categories while count nouns are usually more specific.**

**Examples:**

- There is a car in the street. (singular count noun)
- Question: How many cars are in the street?
- Answer: There are a few cars in the street (plural count noun)

- Question: How much traffic is there?
- Answer: There is a lot of traffic. (noncount noun)

**Noncount nouns always use a singular verb.**

**Count nouns are singular or plural.**

**Much and Many are usually used with the negative:**

**Examples:**

- There `aren't many students` in the classroom. (perhaps 4 or 5 students)
- There `isn't much food` in the refrigerator. ( a small amount of food)

**Any + not, never, or without expresses zero:**

**Examples:**

- There `aren't any students` in the classroom (zero)
- There `isn't any food` in the refrigerator. It's empty.
- He went outside `without any shoes`. (There are no shoes on his feet.)
- They `never` want to eat `any vegetables` or drink `any milk`.

**Much and Many are usually not used in the affirmative:**

**Examples:**

- There are many apples in the basket. <em>It sounds better to say...</em>
- There are <u>a lot of</u> apples in the basket.
- There is much milk in the refrigerator. <em>It sounds better to say...</em>
- There is <u>a lot of</u> milk in the refrigerator.

### Reading Time : Skyscrapers are very tall buildings

`Skyscrapers` are very tall buildings.
They are found in many large, American cities.
`Skyscrapers` in New York City and Chicago reach more than a 1000 feet into the sky (304.8 meters),
which is about the length of three football fields.
These huge structures are appropriately named "skyscrapers" because they are so tall that they seem to touch,
or "scrape" the sky and the clouds.
On a clear day, you can see a skyscraper from several miles away.

Early skyscrapers were built with iron, steel, and masonry;
modern skyscrapers are built with steel, concrete, and a lot of glass.
Skyscraper construction is popular in large cities nowadays because land is very valuable.
The only direction for the development of a large building in a busy downtown is up.
`Skyscrapers` help define a city's skyline,
and they help preserve land for parks and public plazas.

The Empire State Building (right photo) in New York has more than 100 floors.
It's a very famous building.
Tourists enjoy going to the observation deck near the top of the building.
From there, they have a good view of the city.
The Empire State Building was the tallest building in the city until the construction of the World Trade Center buildings in the 1970s.

The tallest skyscraper in the United States is the Sears Tower (renamed the Willis Tower in 2009) in Chicago, Illinois.
The tallest skyscraper in the world is in Dubai (the Burj Khalifa).
It stands at 2,717 feet (828 meters), which is about the length of eight-and-a-half football fields.
Other famous skyscrapers are Tapei 101 in Taipai, Taiwan, Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and the Jin Mao Tower in Shanghai, China.

### Reading Time : Patty invited some friends over for dinner

Patty invited some friends over for dinner.
She moved into her first apartment two months ago,
so she decided to have some friends over to celebrate and show off her new place.
She also started a new job not long ago.
Some of the people that she invited over were from work.

Patty didn't have all the `ingredients` for the dinner that she planned,
so she made a list and then she went shopping at the local `grocery` store.
She never used to go `grocery` shopping when she lived at home with her parents,
but now she has to do everything for herself.

She bought fresh tomatoes, basil, lettuce, broccoli, green peppers, red peppers, some pasta, salad dressing, some olives, and several pounds of chicken. She also bought a few bottles of wine and some beer.
For her guests who don't drink alcohol,
she bought some non-alcoholic drinks.

For an `appetizer`, she made `bruschetta`.
Bruschetta is an Italian `recipe`.
To make it, you start with `toasted` pieces of French bread brushed with garlic and olive oil.
The bread is then topped with a slice of tomato, fresh `mozzarella` cheese, and basil.

For the main course, Patty roasted some chicken and some potatoes.
She also made a pasta salad because some of her guests were `vegetarians` and don't eat any kind of animal meat.

There were 20 people at her party.
It was hard to plan and `prepare` for such a large group,
but everyone had a nice time and loved the food.
Most of Patty's guests brought her a house-warming gift, some wine, or some flowers.
One of her friends brought five apple pies, so after dinner they had the pie for dessert.

Patty's party was a great success!

### Reading Time : Raccoons are common throughout North America

**Vocabulary:** <br/>
**abandoned**: people were in a location, but then they left it. <br/>
**hollow**: empty <br/>
**tasty**: delicious <br/>
**lid**: cover; top <br/>

Raccoons are common `throughout` North America.
They live in `urban`, `rural`, and `suburban areas`.
They make their homes in old, hollow trees, or they live inside `burrows`, which are `holes` `dug` into the ground.
Sometimes they try to make themselves at home in `abandoned` buildings,
and they might even try to get inside your house when it's cold during the winter.

Raccoons are very `intelligent` animals.
They're good at finding food, and they `adapt` well to their environment.
They know that when people put `garbage` outside of their homes, there's probably some tasty food inside the garbage `cans`.
In areas populated by both raccoons and people,
it's a good idea to have a trash can that has a strong lid* and doesn't tip over.
These fury little creatures are very determined to feed themselves and their families.

Raccoons are cute as babies.
In fact, some people try to keep them as pets.
But when they get older, they can become quite large and very `destructive`.
That's one reason why it's not a good idea to keep a raccoon as a pet.

Raccoons are `nocturnal` animals.
That means they are most active at night.
The mother raccoon travels with her babies as they go out looking for food.
Unfortunately, they sometimes walk onto highways where they are hit by cars and trucks.
It's very common to see dead raccoons by the side of the road if you do a lot of `traveling` on highways in the United States.

**How much do you remember from the reading ? Fill in the blanks.**

- Raccoons are often found inside abandoned buildings. What does the word "abandoned" mean?
  - It means there <em><u><strong>haven't</strong></u></em> any people.
- Raccoons are `nocturnal` animals. When are they most active?
  - Raccoons are most active at <em><u><strong>night</strong></u></em>.
- Raccoons are <em><u><strong>cute</strong></u></em> when they are babies.
- When they get older, they can be very <em><u><strong>destructive</strong></u></em>.
- It's not a good idea to keep a Raccoon as a <em><u><strong>pet</strong></u></em>.

## RL11 The future tense

The Future Tense - Will <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>

| singular           | plural               |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| I will -> I'll     | We will -> We'll     |
| You will -> You'll | You will -> You'll   |
| He will -> He'll   |
| She will -> She'll | They will -> They'll |
| It will -> It'll   |

**examples:**

- I'll go to class tomorrow and teach English. (I'll go = I will go)
- You'll go to class tomorrow and learn English.
- He'll go to a movie in the afternoon, and he'll eat a lot of popcorn.
- She'll come to class.
- It will probably snow this week. It'll probably snow this week.
- We'll both be in school tomorrow.
- You'll be there, too!
- They'll play in the snow after school is over.

**Another way to make the future tense is by using "(be) going to."**

I <em><strong><u>will see</u></strong></em> my friends on the weekend. <br/>
I <em><strong><u>am going to see</u></strong></em> my friends on the weekend.

The meaning is the same in both sentences, but the "going to" future is often `preferred` because it sounds a little more `relaxed` and `conversational`.

Practice the "going to" future in the next lesson.

**negatives:**

will + not = won't

**forming questions:**

Will .... ?

Will I drive ?

**helmet**: a hard hat that provides complete protection for the head in case of an accident. <br/>

and a foot brake helps to stop it.
It's very easy to drive.

He built it himself.
He and other people whose hobby it is to build and race go-karts meet at this track on the weekends.

but some members of the racing association he belongs to are serious about winning when they race.

Gas-powered go-karts can reach speeds of up to 30 miles per hour.
It might feel much faster than that when you ride in one because go-karts are low to the ground,
and the ride is a little bumpy.
There's also no windshield.
It's not at all like driving a car.

Frank always wears a `helmet` on his head and other protection for his body when he competes.

## RL13 Like

The word "like" gets special attention in this level because it's a popular word in English.
Understanding how to use "like" is important.

- "Like" expresses your happiness with `something` or `someone`:
  - I like this ice cream. / I like my neighbors.
- "Like" is used to make `comparisons` and to ask questions about people and things:
  - Question: What is it like to live in Minnesota in January?
  - Answer: It's like living in Siberia.
  - Question: Why is he like that?
  - Answer: I don't know. He's just naturally a mean person.
  - A cantaloupe is like a honeydew melon.
  - A honeydew melon tastes kind of like a cantaloupe.
- "Like" is often used with "would" as a polite way of asking what a person wants. You often hear this in restaurants:
  - Question: What would you like to have for lunch?
  - Answer: I'd like a veggie sub, french fries, and a coke. (note the use of the contraction: I'd like = I would like.)
- "How do you like..." is used to ask if someone likes something. It's very similar to "Do you like _______?"
  - Question: How do you like living in this city?
  - Answer: It's great. I really like it.
  - Question: How do you like your pizza?
  - Answer: It's awesome!
- "Like" sometimes doesn't mean anything at all.
Americans use it in the same way they use "you know" and "uuhhhh...." (Try to avoid doing this when you speak English.) It's a bad habit. Teenagers use this "like" a lot.  
  - That movie was, `like`, so good.
  - I was, `like`, really mad at my teacher because he gave me a bad grade, and he was, `like`, "Here. you earned this."

**Warning** : "I like." The verb should have an object somewhere after it. (The exception is example #5.)

- Question: Do you like this car?
- Answer: <s> Yes, I like.</s> (incorrect!)
- Answer: Yes, I like it. (correct!) Or...I like this car.

### Reading time:  "Look! There's a jukebox!"

"Look! There's a `jukebox`!" said Donna.
She got up from the restaurant table she was sitting at with her friends and went over to take a look at a large, old jukebox from the 1950s.
Inside the wooden `cabinet` she could see a stack of 45 rpm vinyl `records`. `Surrounding` the front of the jukebox were orange and yellow lights.

Donna's friend, Bill, `suddenly` became interested. "Does it work?" he asked.

"Well, there's only one way to find out." said Donna. "Do you have any change? It looks like it takes `quarters`."

Bill reached into his pocket for some change and pulled out a quarter. He put the coin into the `slot` that said, "Quarters only."
They could hear it drop down into the machine.

"We get two songs for a quarter.
I'll pick one and you can pick one.
What do you want to hear? asked Bill.

"Is Elvis Presley on here?"
Donna looked through the list of songs and said,
"Elvis Presley. 'Love Me Tender'."

"Okay," said Bill.
"And I want to hear 'Satisfaction' by the Rolling Stones."

Bill pushed the buttons for each song.
They could hear some kind of movement inside the machine,
and soon "Love Me Tender" was playing inside the restaurant.
Everyone was happy with this choice.
