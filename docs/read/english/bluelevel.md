## BL 10 Articles

**Articles 冠词**

`A` / `An` / `The`

| Singular | Plural |
| -------- | ------ |
| a / an   | the    |
| the      | - - -  |

- `Articles` are used in front of nouns.
- “`a`” or “`an`” are always singular.
- “`the`” is singular or plural.
- Some `plural nouns` don’t use an article.

When using articles, it’s important to also know the difference between `count and noncount nouns`.

**A : something is general that is a large category**

1. a dog
2. a house
3. a car

__An : is the same as “`A`”, but this used for noun that began with “`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`” :__

Examples of nouns us “an”:

- an apple
- an elephants
- an island
- an orange
- an umbrella

**The : is used for things that are specific**

1.`The dog` across the street …
2.`The house` next door …
3.`The car` outside

sometimes the word is began with “`h`” : `an hour` , If the vowel sound begins the word , then use “`an`” .

### tips

- First mention : use “`a`” or “`an`”
- Second mention : use “`the`”

### From Video

Example:

1. This is `a video camera`.  `The` camera is seven years old.   (sub by sub)
2. This is `a box`.`The` box is empty. (sub by sub)
3. I’m wearing `an I.D.` badge.`The` badge has my picture on it. (sub by sub)
4. This is `an apple orchard`.`The` apple trees here are very small.`The` apple trees here are very big. (sub by sub)
5. Here comes `a tractor`.`The` tractor is pulling `a group of people`.`The` people having a good time.`The` next tractor is coming to a top.`The` tractor is going through the forest. (sub by sub)

**Next :**

- I have glasses.    (plural - a /an)

Or ….  I have a pair of glasses

- You have a hat.  (singular count noun )
￼
**But … the second time you describe the hat, you say :**

- The hat is blue.

- He has `some strawberries`.  (plural count noun)
￼
- `The` strawberries are in his mouth. (second mention)

- She has `a popsicle`. (singular count noun)
￼
- `The` popsicle tastes good! or ….  Popsicles taste good.

- The cat has `some water`. ( Water is a noncount noun - a /an)
￼
- `The` water is in a bowl. The bowl is purple.

- We have time to learn English. (time and English are `noncount nouns`. Sometimes the is used; sometimes it isn’t.)

- They have a good relationship. (relationship is a singular `count noun`)

All three children have `popsicles`.
`The popsicles` taste good. (Popsicle is a plural count noun)
￼
[Click here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an8HjpVkesM) for a video about using "a" or "an." (youtube)
[Click here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBNvMBpMPt8) for a video about using "the." (youtube)

### “`a`” or “`an`” for one thing

- a cellphone ,

- I have a wallet, in the wallet, there is a dollar , I have one dollar, there’s a dollar in my hand  -> a dollar = one dollar.
- The word “dollar” is count noun, I would say money in my hand, money is a noncount noun

**what’s the difference between count nouns and noncount nouns :**

In this category (count nouns) : things or people `can be count` so : I have a dollar or a cellphone
if I made this words `plural` ,then we can drop the “`a`” , and just add the “`s`”, so you say “`dollars`”  or “`cellphones`”

noncount nouns are those things that can’t really be count, so example with be: ”`water`” or ”`money`” , of course you count money, but when you using it as noun, you are not correcting to  use “a” , don’t use “a” in front of words ,”`a water`” or “`a money`” is incorrect.

For more help with count and noncount nouns , search my channel.

Use the word “an” in front of words start with vowel sounds : `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u` ,these are vowel sounds, example : `an apple`, `an egg`, `an island`, `an orange`, `an umbrella`, all of these count nouns, you can count them, and each be get with a vowel sound,

**word begin with the vowel sound :**

- an hour.
- an old book.
- an icy road.
- an apple pie.
- a large house.

__`a` / `an` / `- -` :__

1. This is `a` track
2. He needs `- -` information. (noncount noun)
3. we have `an` idea
4. They saw `a` movie
5. she likes `- -` pizza.(can be a count none or an noncount none, In this case , that’s the table food.that he likes, she likes, pizza).

__The article “`The`” :__

I have a quarter , The quarter is in my hand.

### There are a lot of rules for articles

1. Don’t put `an article` in front of `the name` or `a place`.
    - _Correct :_ Minneapolis is a great city.
    - _Not correct :_ The Minneapolis is a great city.
    - **But it’s correct to use the name of a place as an adjective :**
    - The Minneapolis skyline is beautiful at night.

2. `Indefinite amounts` or `general qualities` don’t take an article.
    - Pennies are made of copper.
    - The copper in this penny is turning brown. (This is a specific amount)
    - Water is good for you.
    - The water in this glass tastes bad. (this is a specific amount)

## BL 11 Prepositions

**Articles 介词**

Prepositions show location, proximity, and relationships :

- He is standing on a pencil.
- She is at the beach.
- The flower is in the glass.

**in / on / at :**

if somebody ask you a question : where do you live ?

you can answer in one of three different ways :

Use “in” for cities, states, and countries : “I live in Minneapolis.(city)”  or “I live in Minnesota.(state)” or “I live in the United States.(country)”

Use “on” with streets : “I live on Main Street.” you can’t use “in” or “at” in the street.

Use “at” when giving a **complete address** : “I live at 2105 Main Street.” when giving the number and the name of street, you have to do use “at”

if somebody ask you a question : where do you work ?

Then you use the proposition “at” : “I work at ____(an name of the company)” -> “I work at Tony’s Pizzeria”

As same a question is “What do you do ?” your answer : “I work at __**(the name of the company)” or “I work in**_(there is an area of the work)”, example,

- if you are a sale person, you can say “I work in sales”
- if you are a teacher, you can say “I work in education” or “I work at a school”
- if you are a doctor, you can say “I work in health care” or “I work at a hospital”

Where do you eat ?

- I eat at home.
- I eat in/at a restaurant.
- I eat at a table. (when you inside the home or inside the restaurant)
- I eat food on a plate. (The food is on the table and the food is on the plate.)

Prepositions are necessary to learn about. The most important to learn now are “in”, “at”, and “on”. Most prepositions have very specific applications as shown below :

- You can get `into` the house through this door.
- The cat is drinking `from` a bowl.
- There is food `on` the table.

**Another very common preposition is “to”.**

### From video

The word “to” is often used when going from one place to another place.

“What time do you go `to` school ?” from home.

Sometimes the word “to” isn’t used with “home”.

“What time do you go home?” from school. It’s not necessary to use “to” with the word “home” .

"She needs _to go_ `to` the store."

Some students confuse the preposition “to” with the information of infinitive(to go) using “to”.

Proposition follow by a noun , this is a prepositional phrase -> preposition + noun = `prepositional phrase` (介词短语)

“She needs _to go_ `to` the store _to get_ something _to bring_ `to` the party.”

“She needs to go(infinitive) to(preposition) the store to get(infinitive) something to bring(infinitive) to(preposition) the party.”

“to the store” -> prepositional phrase ,

“to get” -> infinitive

“to bring” -> infinitive

“to ” -> preposition phrase.

“to the party” -> prepositional phrase

so the word “to” in this sentence five times, There are three _infinitives_ and two _prepositional phrase_.

Many Americans and the questions sentences with the word “to”, for example : “who do I give this to ?” , “To whom do I give this? (in British english)”

In these questions , you can choice to use “to” at the end or not use “to” :

- “Where are you going ?”
- “Where are you going to ?”
- “where is she Flying ?”
- “Where is she Flying to ?”

if you learning English carefully, you know the word “to” is often used with the verb “go” , for example :

“I have somewhere to go.”

“to go” is infinitive , you can follow the preposition “to” -> “I have somewhere to go to”.

in negative ,“I don’t have anywhere to go” -> “I don’t have anywhere go go to”.

Finally :

Don’t use the verb “to” preposition with the verb “too” , in this case :

“I’m going to the party, Are you going too ?”,

in here , “too” as same as “also”, too = also , It’s a different means

## BL 12 The Past Tense

过去时

There are two types of past tense verbs :

- **regular verbs**: add “ed” to the simple form
- **irregular verbs**: don’t add “ed”

| regular verb simple | regular verb past | irregular verb simple | irregular verb past |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| work                | worked            | be                    | was/were            |
| live                | lived             | get                   | got                 |
| move                | moved             | go                    | went                |
| walk                | walked            | put                   | put                 |
| open                | opened            | eat                   | ate                 |
| wait                | waited            | have                  | had                 |

Regular verbs add `ed` to make the past tense (work/worked) and irregular verb change their form entirely (go/went),

or they don’t change at all (put/put).

The most important verb to learn first in the past tense is “be”.

**Be - Past Tense**

subject + (was/were)

| **Singular** | **Plural** |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| I was        | We were    |
| You were     | You were   |
| He was       |
| She was      | They were  |
| It was       |

- I was at school yesterday.
- We were in New York last week.
- It was cold this morning.

To make the negative , add "not".

| **Single**   | **Plural**    |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| I was not    | We were not   |
| You were not | You were not  |
| He was not   |
| She was not  | They were not |
| It was not   |

Most people use the contractions when making the verb “be” negative in past tense :

- was + not = wasn't
- were + not = weren't

It’s important to know the different between the _present tense_ and _past tense_ :

- I am here today. (present tense) -> the verb “be” is “am”
- I wasn’t here yesterday. (past tense, negative) -> the ver “be” is “was”
- I was here last week.(past tense) -> the verb “be” is “was”

Only the verb “be” changes its form for singular or plural.

All the other verbs, _regular_ and _irregular_ use one form in the past tense,

which makes this tense easy to use for making statements.

More practice with this important verbs comes in [Lesson 16](http://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Blue%20Level/B16%20Be%20Past%20Tense.html).

__Regular Verb : _Learn___

Subject + ____ed

| Singular    | plural       |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| I learned   | We learned   |
| You learned | You learned  |
| He learned  |
| She learned | They learned |
| It learned  |

Use the past tense for any time the comes before

now, yesterday, last week, last year, this morning,

or just a minute ago .

regular verbs :

when learning about the past tense in English ,

It’s important to know the different between the simple form of the verb and the past tense form of the verb :

learn is a regular verb and

- He learned a new song yesterday.
- She learned to grow tomatoes last summer.

When making the negative of question in the past tense,

you just have to add verb “did” before the simple form,

and it make the question in negative  :

- “What **did** you **learn** ?” the “did” is the helping verb(助动词) and the “learn” is the being verb (被动词)
- “They **didn’t learn** anything .” the “didn’t learn” is negative .

To make the negative , use “**did**” + “**not**”(didn’t) + the _main verb_ in the simple form :

| Singular          | Plural             |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| I did not learn   | We did not learn   |
| You did not learn | You did not learn  |
| He did not learn  |
| She did not learn | They did not learn |
| It did not learn  |

Irregular Verb: Have

Subject + _____  ( **irregular verbs** take many different forms in the past tense)

| **Singular** | **Plural** |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| I had        | We had     |
| You had      | You had    |
| He had       |
| She had      | They had   |
| It has       |

Irregular verbs must be memorized because they change their form completely.

[Click here](http://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Blue%20Level/Irregular%20Verbs.html) for a list of commonly used irregular verbs, print it out,

and commit them to memory.

### Review

The Past Tense describes the things you did

yesterday, last year, back in February, in 1973, or an hour ago.

Regular verbs, such as learn, take an “ed” ending after the subject.

- work - - - worked,
- learn  - - - learned,

Irregular verbs change their form entirely or not at all.

- eat - - - ate,
- go - - - went,
- be - - - was/were,

The form of the past tense is not dependent on the subject.

**regular verb** - work :

You worked yesterday.

**Irregular verb** - eat :

## BL22 Addition and Subtraction ：算数加减

**addition or adding :**

| five | `plus` | three | equals | eight |
| ---- | ------ | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| 5    | +      | 3     | =      | 8     |
| two  | `and`  | two   | is     | four  |
| 2    | +      | 2     | =      | 4     |

**Note**: Some English books will use the plural verb “equal” or “are” for the equal sign (=).
Grammatically, this is correct but most people use a singular verb.

**The teacher asks for the answer like this :**

- What’s two plus two ? (use the singular verb for “b” — “is”)
- 2 + 2 = 4 ( two plus two equals four )

**Subtraction or subtracting :**

| five | `minus`     | three | equals | two   |
| ---- | ----------- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| 5    | -           | 3     | =      | 2     |
| ten  | `take away` | seven | is     | three |
| 10   | -           | 7     | =      | 3     |

**Note**: The first example (using “minus”) is preferred over the second, but “take away” is popluar.

**The teacher asks for the answer like this :**

- What’s five minus three ?
- 5 - 3 = 2 (five minus three is two)

Of course, you know how to do math in your own language, but it’s important to practice in English.
Here are some other ways to talk about addition and subtraction :

**Addition :**

```text
A:What do you get if you add six and eight together ?
B:You get 14.

A: If you put two and two together, what do you get ?
B: You get four.

A:If you add 20 to 30 , what does that make ?
B: That makes 50.

The word “makes” is often used when counting money.
```

**Subtraction:**

```text
A: What do you get if you subtract five from nine ?
B: You get four.

A: How much do you have if you take three away from seven ?
B: You have four.

- They`’d like` a new `dog`. (The word “dog” is an object.)
- They`’d like` `to get` a new dog. (“to get” is an  infinitive.)

Most people make a `contraction` with the subject and “would.”  :

- She would like to make a call. = She’d like to make a call.
